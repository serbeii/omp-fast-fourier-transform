This project is an implementation of the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transformation algorithm implemented with omp in C.

The code can be compiled with
```
gcc -fopenmp main.c -o main -lm
```

The code takes 2 optional arguments:
The first argument is for the generated dataset size. If not specified the default is 4096.
The second argument is for the amount of threads to use. If not specified, it will use the max available to omp.
